# üé¨ Hidden Gems in Streaming: Exploratory Data Analysis
Overview

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) inspired by my viral [Buzzfeed article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charmingpear317/underrated-cancelled-tv-shows), where I highlighted ‚Äúhidden gem‚Äù TV shows that audiences loved far more than critics did. The idea was to investigate the gap between audience ratings and critic reviews to uncover shows that may not have received mainstream recognition but still resonated deeply with viewers.

Through this project, I wanted to take the concept further using data analysis and visualization, to see if patterns emerge across genres, platforms, or show types that explain why certain titles end up as underrated favorites.

## Key Questions I Explored

Which shows have the biggest gap between audience and critic ratings?

Are there patterns by genre, platform, or release year?

Which shows can truly be considered ‚Äúhidden gems‚Äù (loved by viewers, overlooked by critics)?

## Methodology

Data Preparation

- Cleaned and merged datasets with audience scores, critic scores, and show metadata.

- Created a new metric: Hidden Gem Score = Audience Rating ‚àí Critic Rating.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized the distribution of hidden gem scores.

- Identified the top 10 shows with the largest audience‚Äìcritic gap.

- Explored genre trends and platform breakdowns.

Visualization

- Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clean, styled charts.

- Designed a bar chart highlighting the Top 10 Hidden Gem TV Shows, showcasing their audience-vs-critic reception.

- Styled plots with a dark theme for a modern, cinematic aesthetic.

## Key Findings

Several shows with low critic scores built strong cult followings and ranked highly with audiences.

Comedy and genre-bending shows often appeared as hidden gems, suggesting critics may undervalue unconventional storytelling.

Streaming platforms vary in how much they produce ‚Äúhidden gems,‚Äù with some consistently underrated hits.

## Tools & Libraries

Python (Pandas, NumPy) ‚Äì data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn ‚Äì visualizations

Jupyter Notebook ‚Äì analysis and documentation

## Why This Project Matters

This project combines my love for storytelling and media analysis with my technical skills in data analytics. It showcases how data can be used to uncover trends that resonate with audiences‚Äîeven when critics disagree.

It‚Äôs also my way of bridging the gap between cultural commentary (the Buzzfeed article) and data-driven insights.

## Next Steps

Expand analysis to include audience demographics (age, region) if available datasets permit.

Compare across time: how does the perception of hidden gems change after release?

Build an interactive dashboard where users can explore hidden gems by genre, platform, or year.
